Conscious Awareness is an application that allows users to be more informed about the social issues in the society by providing factual information to the users. From there, users have the ability to read other user's posts and make comments on any single page. Because many people are formulating their opinions on an issue based on what others say, this application would be able to reduce the biased opinions and allow users to devise their own opinions solely based on the facts given.
