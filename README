Conscious Awareness is an application that allows users to be more informed about the social issues in the society by providing factual information to the users. From there, users have the ability to read other user's posts and make comments on any single page. Because many people are formulating their opinions on an issue based on what others say, this application would be able to reduce the biased opinions and allow users to devise their own opinions solely based on the facts given. 

Instructions:
1. Click on the button with the name of the social issue you wish to read further about. 
2. Read the facts on the page(s) carefully and formulate your own opinion about the issue, whether you are for or against it. 
3. Click on the respective button that corresponds to your opinion regarding the issue. 
4. If there are comments previously written on the page, you may read them to further enhance your knowledge. 
5. Finally, if you wish to, comment your opinion(s) on the respective page(s). 
6. To switch to a different page, click on the navigation bar at the top left corner of your current page. You will then see different tabs. Click on the one you wish to go to. 
7. To change the setting, click on the three vertical dots. A setting tab will appear. Click on it and change the settings according to your preferances.
